#### A pPEG formal grammar for SWI-Prolog syntax

While some implementations of Prolog include a formal specification of their syntax, SWI-Prolog does not; this directory contains such a specification. While it is difficult to know how complete and bug-free it is, but it has been tested on a fair number of example program files including the top level of the SWI-Prolog library directory and the boot directory (as of V8.4.1).

In addition to the grammar, a "parser" program is included to map the ptree result of a *pPEG* parse to Prolog terms to facilitate testing and experimentation.

#### Module `pl_grammar`

This module just exports a string containing the `pPEG` definition of the SWI-Prolog syntax as a string. So typical usage to create a pPEG grammar term would be:
```
?- prolog_grammar(S), peg_compile(S,plg).
```
Parsing a simple term:
```
?- peg_parse(plg,"f(X).",R).
R = 'Prolog'(['Compound'([atom("f"), var("X")])]).
```
The language that is recognized by the grammar consists of one or more Prolog terms, each terminated by the traditional "full stop followed by white space" Prolog terminator.
```
	Prolog = " " (expr _eox)+
	_eox   = " ." (_ws+ / !(~[]))      # end of expression: '.' followed by whitespace or eos
```
Note that the terms are not restricted to clausal terms, so non-programs are valid input:
```
ï»¿?- peg_parse(plg,"[H|T]. 42.",R).
R = 'Prolog'(['List'([var("H"), 'Tail'([var("T")])]), integer("42")]).
```
Currently only 8-bit characters are supported for variable names and unquoted atoms; it would be fairly straight forward, albeit tedious, to extend this to cover a larger Unicode character set.

Most of the grammar is pretty self-explanatory but operator expressions are the exception. First, Prolog operator defintions are defined in a separate "table" and which be extended and, to some degree, modified dynmaically. Therefore the set of operators is not defined by the grammar, as would be the case in most programming languages. Instead a *pPEG* extension is defined to test whether a particular "token" is an operator of the necessary class (`prefix`, `infix`, or `postfix`):
 ```
	# See manual 4.25: "In SWI-Prolog, a quoted atom never acts as an operator."
	op = !"'" _atom / List / Curly / ',' / '|'             # include block operators, ',' and '|'

	PrefixOp  = !('-' [0-9]) op <pl_grammar:testOp prefix> # '-' before number not prefix
	InfixOp   =              op <pl_grammar:testOp infix>
	PostfixOp =              op <pl_grammar:testOp postfix>
```
The `op` rules identifies possible operators syntactically and the `testOp` extension verifies that the operator is of the desired class. Parsing does not include defining new operators, so the set of possible operators defined at the start of the parse operations. Also note that parsing does not depend on any other operator properties other than name and class; properties such as precedence and associativity are part of the semantics and will be addressed in post-parsing semantic analysis.

The second issue with Prolog operator expressions is that operators and operands can be syntactically indistinguishable. For example, "`- - - .`" could mean the term `-('-','-')` or `-(-('-'))`. So the first "`-`" could be either a prefix operator or an atom. In general, a wrong choice could affect subsequent success or failure of rules. In practice this means some look-ahead is required to ensure downstream success and, even then, ambiguity may still exist. In the "`- - - .`" example, SWI-Prolog chooses the `-(-('-'))` result, so the expression rule is:
```
	expr   = PrefixOp " " (&PrefixOp expr / !InfixOp expr)
	       / term " " (InfixOp " " expr " " / PostfixOp " " )*
```
And since expressions are limited when used in compound term arguments and lists, e.g., "`,`" expressions must be parenthesized, separate rules are required to cover those cases.

Note that this parser is not a compiler or loader so to be recognized by the parser, any operator must be defined before a parse is done. Directives, including operator definitions, are just expressions to be parsed.

Now suppose we wanted to change out grammar so that improper lists (lists which don't terminate with a list and do not pass the `is_list/1` test) generate parse errors. This can be easily done by changing the `Tail` rule to:
 ```
 Tail   = " | " (var / List / _mtList)          # insist on a proper list
 ```
so only a variable or a list are permitted after the vertical bar. This is probably a restriction that should have been enfoced as far back as the ISO standard since any violation should probably have been written with a comma rather than the bar. As it turns out, there don't appear to be a lot of code examples where this restriction bites; there are only 3 files in the `swipl library` (top level) or `boot` directories which violate this rule. (Of course, it's still possible to create one dynamically by binding a `Tail` variable to a term other than a list.)

#### Module `pl_parser`

For all but the simplest input, the *ptree* result is hard to read and just as difficult to test. So module `pl_parser` implements a simple parser using the grammar defined in `pl_grammar`. It's only exported predicate is `string_termList/2` which converts an input string defining a sequence of terms to a list of terms:
```
?- string_termList("[H|T]. 42.",TL).
TL = [[H|T], 42].
```
This parser does the first level of semantic analysis on the *ptree* and maps it to a Prolog term, with any variables bound to their names. (This binding is convenient while testing, but can removed by commneting out a couple of lines in the source whre indicated.)Semantic analysis is where all the precedence/associativity rules are applied to generate any operator expression term. As you might suspect, this makes up a significant portion of the parser code. The other major function it performs is mapping if the escape syntax to designated character, e.g., "`\t`" to a tab character or "`\xA9`" to the copyright symbol.

The downside to a strategy like this is that any errors due to operator precedence/associativity violations don't reference the original source location. To partially compensate, the operators are replaced by their `op/3` defintion in error messages:
```
?- string_termList("x<y<z.",TL).
% prolog_parser Error, operator clash in: x op(700,xfx,<) y op(700,xfx,<) z
false.
```
But the main objective of this parser is to assist in verifying the grammar, not to replace the builtin parser, so this shouldn't be much of an inconvenience.

#### Other Utilities

The file `parser_IO.pl` just contains a couple of file system oriented utilities to assist in testing the grammar, e.g., `parse_directory/1` just parses all the files in a named directory. These predicates are fairly trivial and have limited general usefulness.
